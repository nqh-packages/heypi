# Slack Setup

heypi supports Slack Socket Mode and Node HTTP mode.

For a runnable Slack app, see [`../examples/slack-devops`](../examples/slack-devops).

## Create App

1. Open <https://api.slack.com/apps>.
2. Create a new app from scratch.
3. Choose the target workspace.

## Bot Token Scopes

Add these bot scopes under **OAuth & Permissions**:

```text
app_mentions:read
channels:history
chat:write
chat:write.public
files:read
files:write
im:history
reactions:write
```

Install the app to the workspace and copy the bot token:

```bash
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=<slack-bot-token>
```

## Signing Secret

HTTP mode requires Slack's signing secret so heypi can verify incoming Slack requests. Socket Mode receives events over the websocket authenticated by `SLACK_APP_TOKEN`, so a signing secret is not required for Socket Mode.

For HTTP mode, copy the signing secret under **Basic Information**:

```bash
SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET=...
```

## Local Development: Socket Mode

1. Enable **Socket Mode**.
2. Create an app-level token with `connections:write`.
3. Set:

```bash
SLACK_APP_TOKEN=<slack-app-token>
```

Use:

```ts
slack({
  botToken: process.env.SLACK_BOT_TOKEN!,
  mode: "socket",
  appToken: process.env.SLACK_APP_TOKEN!,
  allow: { channels: ["C123"] },
  trigger: "mention",
});
```

Check:

```bash
pnpm exec heypi slack check --env examples/slack-devops/.env
```

## Production: HTTP Mode

Configure Event Subscriptions and Interactivity with the same public URL:

```text
https://<host>/slack/events
```

Use:

```ts
slack({
  botToken: process.env.SLACK_BOT_TOKEN!,
  signingSecret: process.env.SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET!,
  mode: "http",
  port: Number(process.env.PORT ?? 3000),
  path: "/slack/events",
  allow: { channels: ["C123"] },
  trigger: "mention",
});
```

HTTP mode registers Bolt's receiver on heypi's shared Node HTTP listener. It is for normal hosted Node services. If you run multiple Slack HTTP adapters in one app, give each adapter a unique `name` and `path`.

Generate a starter manifest:

```bash
pnpm exec heypi slack manifest --url https://<host>/slack/events
```

## Events

Subscribe to these bot events:

```text
app_mention
message.channels
message.im
```

For private channels, invite the bot to the channel and grant the private-channel scopes required by your Slack app configuration.

## Inbound Access

Slack decides which events heypi receives through app installation, OAuth scopes, event subscriptions, and channel membership. heypi's `allow` config only filters events after Slack delivers them. For channel messages, the Slack app must still be subscribed to the right events and invited to the channel; `allow.channels` does not make Slack send events.

```ts
slack({
  // ...tokens and mode
  allow: {
    teams: ["T123"],
    channels: ["C123"],
    users: ["U123"],
    dms: true,
  },
  trigger: "mention",
  threadTrigger: "message",
});
```

Slack-specific defaults: `channels` applies to non-DM channels only. Private Slack replies, including unauthorized approval/status replies, are posted back into the current thread when Slack provides a thread timestamp.

See [`CHAT.md`](CHAT.md) for shared allow defaults, streaming, busy-thread behavior, approvals, cancel, and delivery.

## Common Failures

`invalid_auth` means `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` is wrong or the app was reinstalled.

`not_authed` usually means the token was not sent or was loaded from the wrong `.env` file.

No messages in channels usually means missing `app_mentions:read`, missing `message.channels`, or the app was not invited to the channel.

Buttons not working usually means Interactivity is disabled or points to the wrong URL.
