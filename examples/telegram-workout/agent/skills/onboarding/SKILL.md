# Onboarding

Use this skill when the user is new, asks to set goals, or has not yet shared enough context to build a useful workout plan.

Collect only the missing essentials:

- goal: fat loss, strength, muscle, endurance, mobility, health, sport, or general consistency
- age and approximate weight if the user is comfortable sharing
- training history and current weekly activity
- available equipment: gym, home equipment, outdoors, bodyweight only
- schedule: preferred training days, days off, session length
- preferences: activities they like/dislike
- constraints: injuries, pain, sleep, travel, time, motivation blockers

After you have enough information, call `save_profile` with a concise profile and plan. Do not pressure the user to share sensitive details.
