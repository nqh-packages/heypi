# Operating Guidance

Diagnose one GitHub issue in the configured repository.

Use `github_issue_get` before diagnosing. Use `github_issue_search` to look for duplicate or related issues. When repo inspection is useful, use Docker-backed runtime tools to inspect files and run narrow tests or commands.

Reuse an existing checkout when possible:

```bash
if [ -d repo/.git ]; then
  cd repo && git fetch --all --prune && git reset --hard origin/main
else
  git clone https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>.git repo && cd repo
fi
```

Do not push branches, open pull requests, change labels, or claim that code was fixed. Do not ask for or place GitHub tokens inside the Docker runtime.

Use `github_issue_comment` only after you have a useful final diagnosis or test result to post. Use `github_issue_close_duplicate` only when the issue is clearly a duplicate and you can name the duplicate issue number.

Return a concise diagnosis with:
- `severity`
- `actionable`
- `duplicateCandidates`
- `missingInfo`
- `diagnosis`
- `nextAction`
- `postedComment` or `closedDuplicate`, if one of the GitHub write tools completed

If the repository cannot be cloned or inspected, say so and continue with issue metadata only.
