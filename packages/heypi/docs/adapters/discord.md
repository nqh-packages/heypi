# Discord

The Discord adapter lets a heypi agent receive Discord messages, stream replies, upload generated files, and render approval buttons.

Discord decides what the bot receives before heypi sees a message. Configure the bot invite, gateway intents, server permissions, channel permissions, and DM availability first; then use heypi's `allow` config to filter delivered events.

For a runnable example, see [`examples/discord-gondolin`](https://github.com/hunvreus/heypi/tree/main/examples/discord-gondolin).

## Options

`discord()` accepts the shared options documented in [Adapters](index.md), plus Discord-specific options below.

| Option | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `token` | Yes | Discord bot token. |
| `name` | No | Adapter name. Defaults to `discord`. |
| `allow.channels` | No | Discord channel IDs where the bot may respond. Thread channels use their own channel ID. |
| `allow.users` | No | Discord user IDs allowed to talk to the bot. |
| `allow.groups` | No | Discord role IDs allowed to talk to the bot. |
| `allow.dms` | No | Whether DMs are accepted. |
| `trigger` | No | `"mention"` or `"message"` for top-level channel messages. Defaults to `"mention"` in channels. |
| `threadTrigger` | No | `"message"`, `"mention"`, or `false` for thread replies. Defaults to `"message"` in active threads. |
| `progress` | No | Progress message behavior, or `false`. |
| `streaming` | No | Draft reply streaming behavior. |
| `delivery` | No | Discord send pacing/retry behavior, or `false`. |

Actor access is `users OR groups`. Channel access is separate. With:

```ts
allow: { channels: ["C1"], users: ["U1"], groups: ["R1"] }
```

`U1` or members of role `R1` can use the bot in `C1`. DMs require `allow.dms` and do not carry server role context.

## Setup

### Manual setup

1. Create an application at <https://discord.com/developers/applications>.
2. Add a bot.
3. Enable **Message Content Intent**.
4. Invite the bot to the server with message permissions.
5. Copy the bot token into your environment.

Required gateway intents:

```text
Guilds
Guild Messages
Direct Messages
Message Content
```

Required OAuth permissions: `Send Messages`, `Read Message History`, and `Add Reactions`.

### CLI-assisted setup

Generate an invite URL and verify the token:

```bash
npx @hunvreus/heypi discord invite --client-id <application-id>
npx @hunvreus/heypi discord check --env .env
```

Use `npx @hunvreus/heypi discord observe` to capture exact guild, channel, user, role, and job target IDs from a delivered message.

## Config

```ts
createHeypi({
	state: { root: "./state" },
	adapters: [
		discord({
			token: process.env.DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN!,
			allow: {
				channels: ["234567890123456789"],
				users: ["345678901234567890"],
				groups: ["456789012345678901"],
				dms: true,
			},
			trigger: "mention",
			threadTrigger: "message",
		}),
	],
});
```

Common environment variables:

| Variable | Required when | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` | Always | Bot token from the Discord developer portal. |
| `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID` | `discord invite` without `--client-id` | Application client ID used by `discord invite` when `--client-id` is omitted. |

For app-wide config such as `state`, `runtime`, and `agent`, see [Configuration](../configuration/index.md).
