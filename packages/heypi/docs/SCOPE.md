# Scope

Scope controls which chats and users share runtime files, generated files, attachments, memory, and scoped skills.

```ts
createHeypi({
	state: { root: "./state" },
	// ...adapters, agent
	scope: "channel", // default: "channel" | "user" | "adapter" | "agent"
	runtime: {
		root: "./workspace",
		// scope: "user", // optional runtime/workspace override
	},
	memory: {
		enabled: true,
		scope: "user", // optional memory override
	},
	skills: {
		enabled: true,
		scope: "channel", // optional skills override
	},
});
```

## Levels

- `channel`: one scope per Slack channel, Telegram chat, Discord channel, or webhook channel.
- `user`: one scope per chat actor.
- `adapter`: one scope per configured adapter instance.
- `agent`: one scope across adapters for this configured agent.

Pi sessions, chat history, approvals, and active-run locks remain per thread. Scope controls shared working context, not the conversation identity.

Use `adapter` or `agent` only when you intentionally want one conversation to affect another through shared files, memory, or skills.

## Overrides

The top-level `scope` is the default for scoped features:

- Runtime workspaces follow `runtime.scope ?? scope`.
- Memory follows `memory.scope ?? scope`.
- Skills follow `skills.scope ?? scope`.
- Attachments follow the top-level `scope`; there is no separate `attachments.scope`.

This lets you combine shared channel files with per-user memory, or per-user workspaces with shared channel skills.

## Layout

Scoped data lives under the configured runtime root:

```text
workspace/
  scopes/
    channel/<agent>/<provider>/<team>/<channel>/
    user/<agent>/<provider>/<team>/<actor>/
    adapter/<agent>/<provider>/
    agent/<agent>/
  attachments/
    scopes/
      channel/<agent>/<provider>/<team>/<channel>/
  memory/
    scopes/
      channel/<agent>/<provider>/<team>/<channel>/MEMORY.md
  skills/
    scopes/
      channel/<agent>/<provider>/<team>/<channel>/<skill>/SKILL.md
```

Secret handoffs are written into the active runtime workspace as `.secrets/<name>`, so they follow runtime scope rather than memory or skills scope.

Path segments are encoded before they are used on disk.

Attachment refs are resolved only against the current scope. A channel-scoped app cannot use an attachment uploaded in another channel, and a user-scoped app cannot use another user's uploaded file.

The built-in `attach` tool uses the active runtime scope, so generated files are uploaded only from the current scoped workspace.

Host-based runtimes (`host-bash`, `guarded-bash`) are not hard filesystem sandboxes. Use `just-bash`, Docker, or Gondolin for team-facing isolation.
