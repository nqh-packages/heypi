# Architecture

Maintainer reference for heypi internals. For app setup, start with [`../README.md`](../README.md), [`CHAT.md`](CHAT.md), [`SLACK.md`](SLACK.md), [`TELEGRAM.md`](TELEGRAM.md), [`DISCORD.md`](DISCORD.md), or [`WEBHOOK.md`](WEBHOOK.md).

heypi is a long-running Node.js process around Pi. It adds chat adapters, durable state, approvals, scheduling, scoped command/file tools, attachments, and admin/runtime integration.

## System Shape

- One Node process owns adapters, scheduling, state, and runtime access.
- Provider events are normalized into `Inbound` messages.
- The handler creates durable turns and calls Pi.
- Pi stores transcripts; SQLite stores operational and audit state.
- Tools execute through scoped runtime roots and approval policy.
- Safety uses explicit boundaries: allowlists, locks, approvals, runtime isolation, and audit rows.

## Startup Model

```text
createHeypi(config)
  store.setup()
  runtime = createRuntime(config.runtime)
  scopedRuntimes = new ScopedRuntimeRegistry(config.runtime)
  callRunner = new CallRunner(...)
  agent = new PiAgent(...)
  handler = createHandler(...)
  http = createHttpServerRegistry(...)
  adapters[].start({ handler, logger, attachments, http })
  http.listen()
  scheduler.start()
```

`runHeypi(app)` installs `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM` handlers and releases the app lock during shutdown. `app.stop()` stops the scheduler and adapters, waits for active runs, then cancels survivors after the drain timeout.

## Main Boundaries

### App

`src/app.ts` is composition only. It wires the store, runtime, call runner, Pi agent, handler, adapters, attachments, admin adapter, HTTP registry, and scheduler.

The app-level lock prevents two processes with the same store from running the same agent at once.

### Config

`src/config.ts` defines the public config API and `agentFrom()` folder convention:

```text
agent/
  SOUL.md
  SYSTEM.md
  AGENTS.md
  skills/
  extensions/
```

`SOUL.md` sets identity and voice. `AGENTS.md` sets operating rules. `SYSTEM.md` is a full runtime-prompt override. Missing `SOUL.md` falls back to a concise built-in identity. The model must be passed explicitly or through `HEYPI_MODEL`.

Programmatic `context` providers run once per turn and append compact dynamic prompt blocks. The handler also injects provider/channel/thread/sender context when available.

### Adapters

Adapters under `src/io/` translate provider events into `Inbound` messages and render `Outbound` replies, approvals, progress, streams, and attachments.

Slack, Telegram, and Discord share `runChatMessage()` after provider-specific allow/trigger checks. Provider lifecycle, buttons/callbacks, attachment transport, and error UX stay in each adapter.

Third-party adapters should implement the public `Adapter` interface from `@hunvreus/heypi/adapter`. The built-in chat adapters are concrete provider integrations, not reusable base classes.

HTTP adapters register routes on the shared Node listener. Routes use the top-level `http` host/port, defaulting to `127.0.0.1:3000`. Duplicate or ambiguous routes fail at startup. `/admin` is reserved.

```ts
type Adapter = {
	name: string;
	kind: string;
	start(input: AdapterStart): Promise<void>;
	send?(target: AdapterTarget, out: Outbound, input?: AdapterStart): Promise<void>;
	stop?(): Promise<void>;
};
```

`name` is the durable adapter instance id stored as `provider`. `kind` is the implementation type, such as `slack` or `webhook`. Duplicate names fail startup.

### Handler

`src/io/handler.ts` is the only place where provider messages become durable turns. It normalizes text and attachments, parses control commands, creates or loads threads, de-duplicates events, locks the thread, handles approvals/cancel/status, writes audit rows, and calls Pi.

Same-thread messages during an active turn use `chat.busy`:

- `steer`: inject into the active Pi session.
- `followUp`: queue after the current assistant reply.
- `reject`: return a public acknowledgement without calling Pi.

Pending approvals reject new asks until approved or denied. Cancel requests only work for the initiating actor or configured approvers in the same thread.

### Pi Runtime

`src/runtime/pi-agent.ts` adapts heypi threads to Pi `AgentSession`s. Pi `SessionManager` is the transcript store. SQLite rows are audit/search/status data and are not replayed as provider history.

heypi does not expose Pi's raw tool runtime directly. It registers Pi-compatible tools backed by the configured heypi runtime and call runner.

### Tools And Runtime

`src/core/calls.ts` owns tool policy, approvals, execution queueing, and call audit rows:

```text
Pi tool call
  -> CallRunner
  -> policy / confirm check
  -> optional approval row
  -> runtime queue
  -> runtime execution
  -> call audit row
  -> optional Pi continuation
```

Core tools and custom `tool()` definitions use the same confirmation path. Text commands and provider-native buttons resolve to the same approval path. Custom `tool()` code runs as trusted host-side JavaScript; tools use the selected runtime explicitly through their execution context when they need command or file work.

`src/runtime/` owns command and file access. One runtime backend or runtime provider is configured per app, and each turn resolves a scoped workspace root:

- `just-bash`: default production runtime.
- `guarded-bash`: host bash with regex guardrails.
- `host-bash`: host bash; unsafe/dev/admin mode.
- `@hunvreus/heypi-runtime-docker`: experimental external Docker provider with one warm container per runtime scope.
- `@hunvreus/heypi-runtime-gondolin`: experimental external Gondolin provider with one warm VM per runtime scope.

`scope` controls workspace sharing: `channel` by default, or `user`, `adapter`, or `agent`. `runtime.scope` can override that runtime/workspace sharing policy independently from memory and skills. File tools enforce size, traversal, and symlink escape limits. `just-bash` disables network by default. Managed runtimes are implemented as `RuntimeProvider`s and can keep scoped runtimes warm until idle timeout, provider shutdown, or explicit management calls. Docker and Gondolin default to a 10-minute idle timeout; `idleMs: false` disables idle shutdown.

### Memory

Memory is optional durable context, not transcript storage. When enabled, heypi stores one `MEMORY.md` per memory scope and injects it before the model turn.

Memory writes are controlled by `memory.writePolicy`. The default becomes `approvers` when `approval.approvers` is configured. Secret and prompt-injection checks are hygiene only; app authors should treat memory as user-influenced context.

### Scoped Skills

Scoped skills are optional durable procedures. When enabled, heypi stores one `SKILL.md` per skill under `skills/scopes/<scope-key>/<skill>/`, injects a compact skill catalog, and exposes `skill_list`, `skill_read`, `skill_write`, `skill_patch`, and `skill_delete`.

Skill writes are controlled by `skills.writePolicy`. Defaults are conservative: writes are `approvers` only when `approval.approvers` is configured, otherwise `off`. Scoped skills are user-authored guidance, not trusted policy. heypi does not include registry install/sync or supporting-file tools for scoped skills yet.

### Secrets

Secret requests are optional encrypted handoffs. When enabled, the agent can call `secret_request` with one or more named fields. heypi generates a request-scoped RSA keypair, sends only the public key in the browser link, decrypts the pasted encrypted blob locally, and writes values as scoped runtime files under `.secrets/`.

The hosted page at `heypi.dev/secret` is static client-side code. Apps can self-host the same page with `secrets.url` and `serve: true`; heypi serves it at the URL path.

### Store

`src/store/` defines store interfaces and the SQLite implementation. The store persists thread routes, message audit/search/status rows, turns, calls, approvals, jobs, job runs, and locks.

Apps must set `state.root`. The default SQLite path is `<state.root>/heypi.db`. Admin state lives under `<state.root>/admin/`. Pi session JSONL files live under the app runtime root.

SQLite supports local single-process deployments. Multi-instance deployments need a shared durable store with lock semantics. Custom stores should implement `transaction()` for atomic handler, call, and scheduler updates.

### Scheduler

`src/core/scheduler.ts` runs `cron` and `heartbeat` jobs. Scheduled turns reuse the same handler path as inbound messages with `scheduled: true`. Adapters that support scheduled outbound jobs must implement `send()`.

### Attachments

`src/io/attachments.ts` keeps inbound uploads in a scoped attachment tree under `runtime.root/attachments/scopes/<scope-key>`. Attachment refs from another scope are rejected under the default `channel` scope.

Supported images go to Pi as image inputs. Text-like files are inlined. Optional document conversion uses the configured local converter. Unsupported or failed conversions remain attachment references.

Outbound generated files are explicit. The built-in `attach` tool records a file from the current scoped runtime workspace, and adapters resolve/upload it with the final reply. heypi does not automatically upload every file the agent writes.

### Delivery And Streaming

`src/io/delivery.ts` serializes sends and retries provider rate limits with backoff per adapter instance.

`src/io/reply-stream.ts` handles optional draft replies while Pi emits text deltas. Confirmed tool calls stop drafts before approval UI. Continuations can start a new draft stream after approval.

## Request Flow

```text
provider event
  -> adapter allowlist + trigger check
  -> handler(Inbound)
  -> thread + message + turn persistence
  -> PiAgent.ask()
  -> Pi SessionManager + heypi tools
  -> CallRunner
  -> runtime / approval / continuation
  -> audit persistence
  -> adapter sends Outbound
```

## Security Model

- provider allowlists filter delivered events
- thread locks prevent overlapping turns in one conversation
- tool calls and approvals are audited
- dangerous bash commands can be blocked or approval-gated
- file tools are scoped and size-limited
- `just-bash` is the safe default runtime
- `guarded-bash` and `host-bash` execute on the host and are unsafe/dev/admin modes

## Supported Deployments

Supported:

- long-running Node process
- Slack Socket Mode
- Slack HTTP mode through Bolt's Node receiver
- Telegram long polling
- Discord gateway
- webhook HTTP mode through Node's HTTP server
