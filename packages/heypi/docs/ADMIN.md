# Admin

The admin panel serves a small web UI under `/admin/*`. It is disabled by default.

```ts
createHeypi({
	// ...
	state: { root: "./state" },
	admin: true,
});
```

Default binding is `127.0.0.1:3000`. On loopback, heypi logs a one-time login URL that expires after five minutes.

Admin uses the same shared HTTP listener as Slack HTTP mode and webhook adapters. Configure that listener with top-level `http`.

For local UI testing only, auth can be disabled:

```ts
createHeypi({
	state: { root: "./state" },
	// ...adapters, agent, runtime
	admin: { auth: false },
});
```

That mode is only accepted on loopback hosts and should not be used for production.

The Slack DevOps example uses `admin: { auth: false }` for local loopback development, so `pnpm run dev:slack` opens the admin panel without a login link. Do not expose that example server on a public interface with auth disabled.

heypi also writes admin state under `<state.root>/admin/`. If the startup link expires while the process is still running, mint a fresh one:

```sh
pnpm exec heypi admin link
npx @hunvreus/heypi admin link
```

Use `pnpm exec heypi ...` or `npm exec heypi -- ...` when `@hunvreus/heypi` is installed in the app. Use `npx @hunvreus/heypi ...` when you want npm to download and run the package. The command reads `server.<pid>.json` plus `HEYPI_ADMIN_SECRET` or the generated local admin secret, verifies that the descriptor still points at the same admin instance, signs a short-lived URL, and prints it. Use `--state <path>` when running outside the app folder, or `--url <url>` when you need to override the descriptor URL, for example through a tunnel or proxy. `--url` is still probed against the descriptor instance id and still needs access to the same state root because the login token is scoped to it.

For non-loopback binding, put admin behind HTTPS and an access-controlled proxy. `secureCookies: true` is required outside loopback. A manual secret is optional; without one, login is only through one-time links minted from local admin state.

```ts
createHeypi({
	state: { root: "./state" },
	// ...adapters, agent, runtime
	http: { host: "0.0.0.0", port: 3000 },
	admin: {
		secret: process.env.HEYPI_ADMIN_SECRET!,
		secureCookies: true,
	},
});
```

Do not expose admin over plain HTTP.

## Pages

- `/admin`: Chats view with recent threads and the selected thread timeline
- `/admin/threads/:id`: thread timeline with user, assistant, approval, and tool activity
- `/admin/approvals`: pending approvals, paged with a maximum page size of 50
- `/admin/jobs`: scheduled jobs configured through app-level `jobs`, paged with a maximum page size of 50
- `/admin/memory`: read-only, paged memory file table with escaped details
- `/admin/configuration`: agent, model, runtime, HTTP, adapter, memory, and process start summary

Memory is durable model context, not chat history or an operational queue. The memory tab lists stored memory files by scope and opens file contents in a details dialog. This matters for `memory.scope: "user"`, where each user can have a separate memory file. The configuration tab shows whether memory is enabled, how it is scoped, and who can write it.

Fresh login links are minted with `heypi admin link`, not from a browser page.

The browser opens an SSE stream at `/admin/events`. Overview counters update live. List pages refresh when the server-side revision changes; thread pages only refresh when the selected thread changes.

## UI assets

Admin CSS is authored in `src/admin/style.css` and compiled with Tailwind CSS plus Basecoat into static assets under `src/admin/assets/`. The server only serves static assets; it does not run Tailwind. CSS is re-read on each request so `pnpm run dev:admin-css` changes appear without restarting heypi.

```sh
pnpm run build:admin-css
```

`pnpm run build` copies those static assets to `dist/admin/assets/` for packaging. Use `pnpm run build:admin-css` only when regenerating admin CSS, or `pnpm run dev:admin-css` while actively editing admin styles.

## Security

- `/admin` is a reserved route prefix. Non-admin adapters cannot register routes under it.
- `admin: { auth: false }` removes login/session checks and is restricted to loopback hosts.
- Sessions are opaque random tokens stored only as hashes in process memory.
- One-time login links are HMAC-signed with the local admin secret, scoped to the canonical state root, expire quickly, and are single-use within the running process. A restart clears the in-memory used-link cache, but unexpired links still expire by timestamp.
- `state.root` is the admin auth boundary. Use a separate state root per agent when login access should be separated. Admin activity, approvals, and calls are filtered by agent when a database is shared.
- `<state.root>/admin/secret` contains generated local admin signing material. The admin state directory is kept private and `state/` should not be committed.
- `<state.root>/admin/server.<pid>.json` contains non-secret admin listener discovery data, including an instance id used by the CLI to reject stale descriptors. It is written only after the HTTP listener has a real port.
- Unsafe actions require a CSRF token and same-origin check.
- Memory is shown as untrusted text, not rendered Markdown.
- Admin CSS and JavaScript are served locally from `/admin/assets/*`. Admin does not load UI assets from a CDN.
- v1 does not include chat-issued admin links, approval execution from the web UI, config editing, secret editing, or shell access.
